# OV-data-retrieval

This repository contains an Rmarkdown file which mainly contains the code to retrieve the data from the ovarian cancer cohort of the TCGA database. Some preprocessing steps are included which are applied on the different omics data retrieved, in order to make the data usable for MOFA analysis. MOFA analysis is being used for the purpose of integrating the multi dimensional omics datasets. Hence a list is created from the retrieved data which is further used to create an untrained MOFA object. The output of this code is an HTML file.

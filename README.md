# OV-data-retrieval

This repository contains an Rmarkdown file which mainly contains the code to retrieve the data from the ovarian cancer cohort of the TCGA database. Some preprocessing steps are included which are applied on the different omics data retrieved, in order to make the data usable for MOFA (Multi-omics factor analysis). These include: downsizing of the data, trimming the column names (TCGA barcodes), converting the methylation beta values to M values, removing the missing values, get only three classes of values for the CNA data -> -1, 0, +1. MOFA is being used for the purpose of integrating the multi dimensional omics datasets. Hence, a list is created from the retrieved data which is further used to create an untrained MOFA object. First, a MultiAssayExperiment object is created and this is used to build the MOFA object. This is the Bioconductor approach of creating a MOFA object. The output of this Rmarkdown file is an HTML file where one can see the code chunks with a short description of what they do. The HTML file can also be found in this repository.
